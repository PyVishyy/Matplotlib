# Matplotlib
<P> This is a <strong> repo </strong> i made for posting what i have learnt by matplotlib. So it is gonna have <strong> examples </strong>, <strong> basic models </strong> and these 2 things in <strong> jupyter notebooks </strong> (also available for google colab). </p>

<p> The <strong> example.py </strong> in all folders are gonna have the minimum code required for that graph or chart. The 
  <strong> Basic.py </strong> is gonna have the code, which is gonna make the graph or chart get complete look. The <strong> .ipynb </strong> is
 gonna have the both example.py and basic.py in jupyter notebooks, so it will be easy to see code and result at same time.</p>
